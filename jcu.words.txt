University Plan
2013

Strategic Intent

Our strategic intent is to create a brighter future for life in the tropics world-wide through graduates and
discoveries that make a difference [www.jcu.edu.au/about/strategic-intent/index.htm].
A defining feature of JCU is our tropical location and excellence in disciplines of particular relevance to the
tropics. As a comprehensive university in the tropics, JCU is well placed to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration
to meet these challenges. To this end, JCU is committed to providing shape and direction to our teaching,
research and engagement through alignment with four themes:
 Tropical Ecosystems and Environment
 Industries and Economies in the Tropics
 Peoples and Societies in the Tropics
 Tropical Health, Medicine and Biosecurity
This, the University’s triennial plan, builds upon the Strategic Intent through the statement of Our Priorities and
in the presentation of aims and objectives in relation to our Core Business and the Enablers - the resources,
services and capabilities that underpin the activities of the University. The Strategic Intent has a five to ten year
outlook while the University Plan has a three to five year outlook.

Our Priorities
JCU is distinctive. The University was established as Australia’s
university for the tropics and for the past 50 years JCU has drawn
scholarly inspiration from its location in the Australian tropics. The
distinctive character of JCU is a product of our place. Collectively, the
priorities of the University define us: They arise from and express the
distinctiveness of JCU.

A university for the
Tropics, World-Wide
Our aim is to position JCU as a national
and international leader in teaching and
research addressing critical challenges
facing the tropics, world-wide. We
commit ourselves to research of
excellence and high impact, particularly
on issues of critical importance to the
world’s tropics. We will build on current
areas of world-class excellence to achieve
strong performance in scholarship and
teaching, inspired by a research-enriched
environment. We recognise that the
University is judged not only on its
quality but equally on its wider relevance,
impact and the force and integrity of its
intellectual leadership.
Our success will be reflected in the
reputation and standing of the
University, the level of our international
engagement, the extent to which our
research has impact, and in the extent
to which our research, teaching and
student experience is aligned with the
strategic intent.

One University, Two
Countries, Three
Tropical Campuses
Through our three tropical campuses
– Cairns, Townsville and Singapore JCU will become a tri-city university
at which internationalisation is an
integral dimension of our intent and
our make-up. The University began
in Townsville more than 50 years ago
and in Cairns 25 years later. In 2011 the
Singapore campus, established in 2002,
became fully integrated in a corporate
sense. Our stronger engagement in
Singapore promises to enliven and add
a new dimension to our strategic intent,
broadening our tropical agenda and
making the tropics more fully our place.

Our three tropical campuses are
complemented by regional and
remote study centres and research
stations through which JCU extends
its reach and responsiveness to our
northern Queensland communities.
We will measure our achievements in
terms of the development of teaching
and research, mobility of students,
and in terms of integration and
harmonisation of our activities across
the three campuses.

People and Place
Our aim is to position JCU as an employer of
choice for staff and a University of choice for
students, by building an environment which
facilitates and rewards excellence, performance
and productivity, values equity and diversity,
and fosters community spirit and personal
well-being. JCU will continue to build on its
reputation for being socially responsive, and in
particular, meeting the needs of people in rural,
remote, Indigenous and tropical Australia.
We are committed to excellence, equity, diversity
and wellbeing for our students, staff and our
alumni who come from many backgrounds.
We are enriched by our northern Queensland
region, being home to Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples and we recognise their
special spiritual relationship with the land and
sea. Our campuses are situated in diverse
tropical landscapes and these settings enliven
and enrich the way in which the University
operates.
JCU is committed to building a strong sense
of community and belonging for its students,
staff and alumni. We support the total student
experience, by understanding that learning does
not only take place in the classroom, and that
students’ time spent at the University is about
a broad range of experiences and engagement
with the University community, that fosters
student success. We support and develop
staff throughout the employment lifecycle,
understanding that supporting and building
capability will develop leaders of the future.
The success of the University will be measured
in relation to graduate outcomes, student
satisfaction, and in terms of the profile of our
student body.

Our Priorities

Development, More Sustainably

Connecting, Locally and Globally

Sustainable development finds expression in how we
deal with global challenges such as climate change
adaptation, diminishing biodiversity, food security,
human rights, poverty alleviation, multiculturalism and
global security. Our sustainability vision is anchored
in the belief that social, environmental and economic
sustainability must be embedded in our daily practices
and integrated in everything we do. Sustainable
development is rooted in respect for our natural and
social contexts, and in the knowledge that we will be
judged by future generations according to our success
in realising our sustainability goals.

JCU’s scholarly activities are inspired by its locations
in the tropics. The University brings perspectives
and understanding to our local communities that are
informed by our interactions globally, while our window
on the global tropics is framed by our experiences
locally. As a regionally-based university, we recognise
our obligation to engage with industry and government
and to share our research findings. We achieve critical
mass through productive research partnerships with
other research organisations. JCU recognises its
“power of place” and engages with its communities of
interest to promote a sustainable region that is socially
inclusive. JCU will continue to be a good corporate
citizen, responding proactively in terms of our civic
responsibilities, interacting with our stakeholders in
a mutually beneficial way to ensure that our regions
grow and prosper sustainably. JCU will be a partner and
advocate, integral to the social, cultural and intellectual
life of its communities.

In seeking a brighter future for people in the tropics
worldwide, JCU staff and students will work to ensure
that our actions today do not limit the range of social,
cultural, environmental and economic options of future
generations. Through our scholarship and practices,
JCU seeks to meet the challenges that affect the tropics,
and in doing will materially contribute to sustainable
development, world-wide.
Our progression towards improved sustainability will
be measured in terms of improved financial security,
reduced resource use, and reductions in waste.

Though regional in status we will look to enable
and attain a full and seamless integrated experience
with research entities, employers, campuses and
outreach locations locally and across the world. We
will explore, implement and support opportunities for
collaboration and learning to occur both physically
and virtually through the encouragement of staff and
student mobility and information and communication
technology capacity to provide a global depth and
reach to our activities.
Our performance will be assessed in terms of student
participation, recognition through social media, and
in the productivity of our partnerships in teaching
and research.

Core Business
Learning and Teaching
AIM
To deliver high quality learning environments and programs that are inclusive, relevant and engaging, position students at the heart of
the university experience and lead to excellent outcomes for graduates.
STATEMENT OF CONTEXT
Over the last triennium we have enacted an institution-wide curriculum vision that seeks to align our courses and the delivery of them
with the University’s Strategic Intent and four tropical themes.  Our staff have been recognised for their outstanding contributions to
student learning through national teaching awards and citations, and we have established a Teaching and Learning Academy to provide
an explicit focus on the scholarship of learning and teaching.
In the context of a new national regulatory and quality assurance framework, we are challenged to manage growth and widening
participation with a demonstrable commitment to quality and excellence. We will therefore continue to refine our policies, practices
and processes to assure academic standards, quality and integrity and to embed a culture of continuous improvement, informed by
scholarship, practice and meaningful learning and teaching data.  We will also continue to ensure that our professional programs secure
accreditation to meet community and professional needs and to remain at the forefront of national and international best practice.
We recognise that knowledge has the power to change lives and we are committed to meeting the varying learning and support needs
of all students. We will continue to focus on improving retention and the student experience and be responsive to the impact of attrition
and retention on the viability of our programs. In undertaking all of these activities, JCU will particularly strive to improve access and
retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and students from non-traditional and disadvantaged backgrounds.
OBJECTIVES
1)	

Continue to develop and assure high quality learning environments that emphasise the Curriculum Refresh themes, in particular
our tropical focus.

2)	

Build and enhance teaching capacity and learning leadership through the delivery of appropriate professional development
opportunities and other targeted support.

3)	

Deliver flexible and inclusive learning environments that capitalise on both face-to-face and virtual innovations.

4)	

Implement and monitor effective and integrated strategies to improve pathways, retention and the student experience.

5)	

Refine approaches for mapping, assuring and enhancing course learning outcomes and the collection of assurance of learning
data, and develop processes for external benchmarking of academic standards against similar courses of study.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Core Business
Research and Innovation
AIM
To undertake and deliver research and research education that is at the forefront of scholarly activity nationally and internationally.
Our research will be visionary, generating discoveries that make a difference by advancing disciplinary knowledge, and benefiting the
wider community, government and industry.
STATEMENT OF CONTEXT
Over the last triennium JCU has progressively increased its research grant income and publications. The University will continue to
establish new institutes and centres in areas of research strength. A training and mentoring program for Early Career Researchers has
been established, and research performance reporting has improved.
Research capability and performance is variable across the University, though. In particular, the number of staff who are competitive in
prestigious research grant competitions needs to increase. The retention and recruitment of high performing research staff is a risk for
the University. Domestic demand for HDR places remains soft, while scholarships for international HDR students are limited in number.
Acquiring, maintaining and operating research infrastructure presents financial and other resource challenges.
The preciseness of JCU’s Strategic Intent delivers focus. The ‘power of place’ is a magnet for people with research interests in many fields
of research in the tropics. There is the potential to achieve step-changes in research performance in several fields, including notably
health and medicine and in the social sciences. Recent appointments, particularly the Tropical Leaders, have increased the depth and
breadth of research capability. Research performance in key research fields continues to improve, and we are building national profiles
around our areas of expertise. As our expertise and networks continue to grow, we are increasingly extending our research collaborations
internationally, focussing on our commitment to improving life in the tropics worldwide. These achievements and aspirations are
increasingly being recognised, with JCU becoming a prestigious employer of people with varied tropical research expertise.
OBJECTIVES
1)	

Increase the alignment of research and research education with the strategic intent, purpose and values of the University.

2)	

Develop the capability of our staff to participate in high quality, relevant research and recruit and retain staff whose research
interests are strongly aligned with our strategic intent.

3)	

Procure and maintain infrastructure to support world-class research and research education, particularly in our areas of research
priority.

4)	

Develop real value partnerships regionally, nationally and internationally to support our research endeavours and research
education in our defined areas of research priority.

5)	

Deliver best practice research education and training to our post-graduate students, by providing quality learning environments,
academic support, and effective candidature management.

6)	

Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of research and research education support services and the associated processes.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Core Business

Engagement
AIM
The University through its staff, students, graduates, research outcomes, and partnerships will engage with communities, industry and
the professions in the tropics world-wide, and be recognised and acknowledged as a leading international university for and of the
tropics.
STATEMENT OF CONTEXT
For more than 40 years JCU has focussed on issues of importance to the tropical world, and has been a key driver of sustainable social,
cultural and economic development in northern Queensland. JCU embraces the diversity of the communities it serves in two countries,
and works with those communities and key stakeholders to create opportunities and lasting benefits. In addition, through our work
integrated learning (WIL) programs across a variety of disciplines, and through student-led clinics, JCU is expanding the range of services
available to communities.
Key risks include increased competition for domestic undergraduate students, and the volatility of the international student market
caused in part by economic circumstances, government regulation and increased competition.
OBJECTIVES
1)	

Provide opportunities for our students to travel and study overseas through cross-campus opportunities, exchanges, short courses
and study abroad programs.

2)	

Engage with our domestic and international graduates by facilitating alumni groups and developing ways in which they can
meaningfully contribute to Our Institutional Priorities.

3)	

Be a partner and advocate, integral to the social, cultural and intellectual life of our communities.

4)	

Engage with professional bodies, employers, government agencies and other relevant stakeholders to ensure our research and
academic programs advance the needs of our region and the tropics world-wide.

5)	

Attract students, staff and visitors from within and outside the tropics, and thereby promote understanding and advocacy of the
region.

Organisational Effectiveness
AIM
To be an innovative university with a culture of accountability, responsive to opportunity and with the capacity to respond to the everchanging external environment. We will achieve organisational and operational effectiveness through high quality leadership and
management.
STATEMENT OF CONTEXT
Through good leadership and management we plan, implement, evaluate and improve the University’s operations and performance.
We are accountable through informed and flexible decision making based on our values, evidence-based analysis, and client satisfaction.
Our decisions and services are aligned with the University’s strategic intent, priorities and core business. We continuously improve by
maximizing value and using resources wisely and encourage individuals to challenge preconceptions of service delivery and to develop
ideas for improvement and efficiency.
Services such as the BRIT (Business Review Improvement Team), and the ICT (Information Communication Technology) Projects Office
along with the implementation of new processes such as the quality enhancement framework, Prince 2; and new systems including the
BI (Business Intelligence) system, assist to review, revise, and redesign processes so that we can deliver business in the most sustainable,
efficient and effective way.
OBJECTIVES
1)	

Enhance and promote a culture of continuous improvement and accountability.

2)	

Implement systematic evaluation and assessment of university performance and operational effectiveness.

3)	

Provide high quality client service, decrease costs, and improve productivity and results.

4)	

Effectively communicate improvements and changes.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Enablers

Human and Intellectual Capital
AIM
To attract, engage, develop and retain quality people with the skills, knowledge, experience, competencies and values required to fulfil
the needs and deliver the outcomes of the University both now and in the future.
STATEMENT OF CONTEXT
It is well documented that in the next 5-10 years there will be more exits from the workforce than incoming recruitments due to
decreased fertility rates and the aging of the Australian population. The recent Global Financial Crisis and the removal of a forced
retirement age have delayed the impact of the restricted labour market, although some areas are discovering recruitment is becoming
more competitive. Therefore, the focus on retaining employees through strategies and initiatives that support the employee value
proposition is becoming increasingly critical.
Alignment between strategic workforce planning and corporate planning is required in order to forecast future demands and identify
potential supply. Strategic workforce planning can be used to expand, or reduce, or better utilise a workforce and enables a direct link of
the workforce to the future direction of the University. The University must become more flexible and agile in order to be responsive to
changing demands. Industrial frameworks must deliver flexibility to the University.
Strategic planning will be used to develop staff initiatives and workforce development programs by identifying future capability
and cultural requirements. It drives not only the professional development agenda, but also informs the development of strategic
recruitment and retention programs.
JCU is committed to developing its future leaders. Strategic workforce planning will inform target areas for succession management
programs, which will see the development of leadership potential, including supporting the current leaders in continuing to grow and
impart their skills through active participation as coaches, mentors, teachers, and through leadership by example.
JCU has had a strong commitment to equity and diversity in the workplace and aspires to continue to develop a workforce that is
reflective of the diversity, capacities and capabilities of population from the regions in which we operate.
OBJECTIVES
1)	

Align workforce planning to the corporate planning cycle in order to identify and plan for future capability requirements.

2)	

Attract, develop and retain quality employees and be recognised by the Commonwealth Government as an Employer of Choice.

3)	

Deliver a HR framework that affords flexibility to meet future University change.

4)	

Develop an effective management culture and leadership capabilities.

5)	

Create an environment that recognises and supports the diverse cultural communities, in which the University resides.

6)	

Ensure the well-being of staff/students/visitors by providing healthy and safe campuses and facilities.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Enablers

Physical and Virtual Infrastructre
AIM
To align our physical and virtual infrastructure such that they enable our scholarly institution and enable transformation of our campuses
into places of international renown and which are welcoming, safe, sustainable and fit-for-purpose. As a research institution, staff and
post graduates will be supported by appropriate learning spaces, services and information and communication technologies that
enhance and promote JCU as a centre of excellence within the wider research and academic community.
STATEMENT OF CONTEXT
We speak of the power of place, of our location being our laboratory. While that place is the tropics, the notion of place also speaks to our
physical locations and facilities. In recent years, we have significantly increased our investment in physical and virtual assets to underpin
our work and to enable staff and students to work and study in an environment of the calibre they deserve.
We must continue to focus on the development and delivery of targeted, sustainable, enabling infrastructure and services - a fresh
interpretation on the importance of place. Our investment in, and costs of, managing our estate will increase significantly over the
next decade as we continue to grow Cairns at a rapid pace, meet accreditation, pedagogical and research related requirements
and establish a campus in Singapore which is in keeping with our aspirations. We will be looking at increasing our use of existing
space and implementing new measures for energy efficiencies to help in managing spiralling costs. We have been able to deploy
significant additional funding to invest in our physical and virtual infrastructure. This will start the long process of redressing our ageing
infrastructure and capital renewal challenges.
We will provide information and communication technology systems and services that achieve a balance between the corporate,
research and teaching and learning needs whilst demonstrating resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. Our ICT systems
will be designed to enable our scholarly activities both on and off our campuses.
Continuing this level of investment will create a tension between operating and capital investment. Failure to continue to invest in
physical and virtual infrastructure will impact on our future aspirations.
OBJECTIVES
1)	

To deliver safe and contemporary learning spaces which enhance our campuses so that they become a place of destination.

2)	

Be a leader in environmentally sustainable infrastructure development and operations and innovative information and
communication technologies.

3)	

Create a knowledge community through the implementation of Discovery Rise.

4)	

Provide a robust virtual and physical environment that fosters sustainable teaching and research and builds a sense of community
both on and off our campuses.

5)	

Increase utilisation of existing space to maximise return on investment and defer the need for investment in new infrastructure.

6)	

Investigate alternative development options for new infrastructure (eg Clinical Practice Building and the Science Place as well as
Cloud hosted ICT solutions) which seeks to minimise the impact of operating costs on existing operations.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Enablers

Finance and Resources
AIM
To be financially sustainable and ensure sufficient resources are available to invest in our continued growth to enable achievement of our
aspirations.
STATEMENT OF CONTEXT
We are operating in an increasingly competitive global environment, confronted by new challenges and opportunities, both domestically
and internationally. We need to be sensitive to international events including factors outside our control. We are experiencing increased
competition within our region from other universities. The introduction of the new demand driven model from 2012 has served to
heighten competition and so we will need to be vigilant around our branding and marketing strategies. Domestic student demand
tends to be counter-cyclical to economic performance.
Changing Government policy and funding arrangements will influence how we operate, and we need to be mindful of the changing
external environment, while remaining true to our strategic intent, and serving the needs of our region.
We are in an investment phase as part of the next stage of our development. Investment decisions are informed by the Strategic Intent.
This will involve the need to prioritise our resources in order to deliver on the Strategic Intent and objectives expressed in the University
Plan, and creating the capacity to continue to invest in our future. The prioritisation of resources is an annual event carried out in
accordance with the prescribed processes and aligned to the Vice-Chancellor’s priorities set annually. The focus is to continue to grow
our income whilst also controlling expenditure.
The triennium budget is the University’s financial response to the University Plan. It is important that there is a consistent financial
framework, where planning, budgeting, performance and reporting are aligned.
Planning targets are developed for our student population at each of our campuses in Townsville, Cairns and Singapore. We are
projecting to grow our research income. The University Budget is developed using these targets to project income and set out the path
to deliver on the targets. These targets are seen as challenging, but attainable.
Managing in a volatile environment presents challenges and the need to be responsive to external factors. Careful scrutiny of our
operations will be required to ensure that we remain competitive and resilient and optimise our capacity to responsibly undertake our
core business.
OBJECTIVES
1)	

Manage resources in an ethical, financially responsible and sustainable way.

2)	

Realise capabilities to achieve a consistent and efficient financial management framework with strong accountabilities.

3)	

Ensure that we have a teaching funding base sufficient to support our research aspirations and a planned approach to enterprise
management and growth.

4)	

Invest in initiatives to counter the domestic and international challenges around student demand.

5)	

Adopt a continuous improvement culture which seeks to enhance productivity and ensure value for money.

6)	

Integrate the risk management framework into University wide processes, procedures and decision-making.
